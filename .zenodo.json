    "description": "<p>The Atlas of Historical County Boundaries is a resource created by <a href=\"https://www.newberry.org/\">The Newberry Library</a>, Chicago, Illinois, to document changes in county and county-equivalent boundaries in the United States of America over time. In 2019, The Newberry Library donated the project shapefiles to the Library of Congress and released them under a <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/\">Creative Commons CC0 &quot;No Rights Reserved&quot; License</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Each multipolygon feature in the project shapefile data represents a particular government unit (or non-county or disputed area) for a particular time period. In order to avoid duplication of shared boundaries, the scripts in this repository convert these features into least common geometries,<sup>1</sup> which, once further converted to a PostGIS topology and exported as edges (or &quot;ways&quot;), can be imported into other projects with topological data models, like OpenHistoricalMap.</p>\n\n<p>The files that were exported as a ZIP archive by the scripts are included in the release in the output folder. For additional information, see the README.md file.</p>\n\n<p>1.
